The above conversation is an automated transcript between a call centre agent and an insurance subscriber or 
patiet. I want to extract few key entities like name of patient, status of insurance, insurance number, 
demographic details etc. All or some information may be present in this transcript.
Extract the entities that you are able to find from this piece of call transcript.
In the above text, if you find any section that talks about appointment or schedule time and contains text 
like 'this week', 'next week', 'this Friday', 'next Monday' etc; please convert that pharase to the actual 
date considering the difference from today's date which is """ + today + """

The output would be a structured json with only the extracted fields. Just print the exact output.
No need to print any extra text. Also do not generate an answer if that is not found in the transcript.
